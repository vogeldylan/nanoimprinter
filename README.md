# Nanoimprinter
Code library for the Nanoimprinter project at NUS.

## Introduction
To get a local copy of the libraries onto your computer, you can install the GitHub desktop client and clone the files onto your machine.
Alternatively, if you're using either macOS or linux, you can open Terminal, navigate to the place where you want to clone the repository, and type:

```git clone https://github.com/vogeldylan/nanoimprinter```

This will download a copy of the repository into your current directory. In the future, you can navigate to the newly downloaded *nanoimprinter* folder and type `git pull` to pull the most recent updates.

To add code you've edited on your computer to the GitHub library, you can use Terminal to navigate to the *nanoimprinter* folder, type `git add .` to add your most recent changes, and type `git commit` to specify a commit message before uploading. You can then use `git push origin` to push to the master branch, or specify a branch using `git push <your branch>`.

If you encounter an error, git will tell you to pull the most recent changes from master and manually merge them. Open the conflicting file in question and find the section that git has highlighted. Manually merge the conflicting code and repeat the above process to push your merged files to the repository.

On the desktop app you can simply press *sync* to sync your most recent changes.

## Usage

See the Software Guide included in the GitHub repository.
